Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers use their hands extensively for the rescue operation and providing care to the patients in an EMS scene. Using smartwatch based sensor data, i.e., accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, we are developing SenseEMS, a system for hand operated EMS intervention detection and real-time monitoring. SenseEMS will use a hybrid deep neural network with appropriate real-time algorithms on the sensor data to detect multiple hand operated activities, i.e. CPR compressions, attaching defibrillation pads and breathing bags, and to provide quality assessment on different metrics of the activity, i.e., the rate and depth of CPR compressions. Our initial results for this ongoing research show promising accuracy. Preliminary survey with 31 anonymous EMS responders suggests that this automated system will be highly beneficial for real-scene application and EMS training.
