<br />
I am a 3rd year Computer Engineering Ph.D student at the University of Virginia in the Dependable Systems and Analytics Lab. I received my B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.

Most of my projects and research have a bias towards the field of medicine, as a result of my interest in that area. Feel free to go through my [projects](https://sites.google.com/view/kesharaw/home) to see for yourself! I desire to broaden my knowledge and research experience and continue serving the world as a whole.


### Research Interests

* Medical Cyber Physical Systems
* Surgical Robotics
* AI/ML Assistance for Medical Services
* Dependability and Safety in Cyber Physical Systems
